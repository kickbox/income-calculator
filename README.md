# Income Calculator

I created this income calculator to understand the pros and cons between starting a business and working in a Job. The hardest part of a business is overcoming the the risks involved in making it successful.

I would suggest to protect your downside by creating tiny projects that would take care of your monthly expenses. Or you could save a huge pile of money to have long runway for your new business.

You can input your variables in the calculator to find how much value(in dollars) can you capture in the long term.
